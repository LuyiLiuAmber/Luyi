127) Explain the difference between operational and informational systems as well as the primary factors that contribute to the need for separation.
Answer:  An operational system is built to run a business in real-time using current data. An informational system is designed to support decision making based on historical point-in-time data. There are three primary factors which dictate the need to separate operational and informational systems:
1. A data warehouse centralizes data that may reside on several different systems.
2. A properly designed data warehouse improves the quality and consistency of data.
3. Contention for resources can be reduced by separating the informational system from the operational system.

3. It is difficult to relate data across data marts.
4. Scaling costs are excessive. Every new application that creates a separate data mart repeats the ETL process.

130) Explain the dependent data mart and operational data store architecture.
Answer:  The dependent data mart and operational data store architecture address some of the limitations of the independent data mart. Data is loaded from source data systems into a data staging area (called the operational data store). As part of this load process, the data are cleaned, reconciled, derived and transformed. The enterprise data warehouse is then loaded from the operational data store. Each individual data mart is loaded from the enterprise data warehouse. This is different from an independent data mart architecture, where each data mart is loaded from the data staging area. By having an enterprise data warehouse, the organization can maintain control of data quality and integrity by having one "gold standard," which is the enterprise data warehouse.

131) What is a logical data mart and what makes this architecture unique?
Answer:  A logical data mart is created by a relational view of a data warehouse. Some of the unique characteristics include:
1. Rather than having separate data marts, one can have several logical data marts which are only relational views of one physical data warehouse.
2. The data warehouse is used for cleansing and transformation rather than a separate staging area. 
3. New data marts can be created quickly. There is no need to create a new physical database or write any loading routines.
4. The logical data mart is always up to date because it is a view of the warehouse. The data warehouse only needs to be updated, since views are populated when used.

132) Discuss the three-layer data architecture.
Answer:  The three-layer data architecture describes how we view data in the data warehouse.

Reconciled data are intended to be the single source for accurate data used by all decision support applications. Derived data are used by the data marts. It has been selected, formatted and aggregated for decision support applications.

2. Enterprise data warehouse metadata describe the reconciled data layer as well as the rules for extracting, transforming, and loading operational data into reconciled data.

Answer:  OLAP stands for On-Line Analytical Processing. It is the use of a set of reporting and querying tools which allows the user to use simple windowing techniques to analyze multi-dimensional views of their data. The multi-dimensional view of the data can be thought of as a data cube. There are several variations of OLAP including: ROLAP (Relational OLAP) which uses SQL and view the database as a traditional relational database. MOLAP (Multi-dimensional OLAP) creates a data store where the data is viewed in its multi-dimensional format. Some less common tools are DOLAP, which builds OLAP into the query language, and HOLAP, which offers both multi-dimensional as well as relation query language access to the data.

136) Explain what the star schema is.
Answer:  The star schema is a simple database design. Dimensional (or descriptive) data are separated from fact or event data. The star schema consists of a fact table, which contains event data as well as links to dimensions. Dimension tables contain descriptive information. For example, we might have a dimension for sales territory which would have a unique ID as well as several levels of granularity. There might be a territory description, state, city, zip code, etc. The dimension key is also in the fact table. In this way, it is fairly simple to look up information and do some drill-down type queries.

137) What is the surrogate key rule for the star schema, and what are the main reasons for this rule?
Answer:  Each and every key used to join the fact table with a dimension table should be a surrogate key (meaning system-assigned) and not a key which uses a business value. The reasons that a surrogate key is required are the following:
1. Slowly, over time, business keys change. A surrogate key allows us to handle changing business keys easily.
2. Surrogate keys are shorter and simpler.
3. Surrogate keys can be the same length and format, regardless of the business dimension.

138) Explain a situation where multiple fact tables may be necessary.
Answer:  Multiple fact tables are useful in situations where different groups of users may need different sets of facts.

In this case, we may have two shared dimensions: date and product. These are called conformed dimensions.

140) What are some approaches to handling slowly changing dimensions?
Answer:  Dimensional data changes slowly over time. There are three possible ways to handle slowly changing dimensions:
1. Overwrite the current value with the new value. This is not an acceptable solution, since it eliminates the description of the past which might be needed to interpret some data.
2. If we know how many changes there will be, make a multi-valued attribute which will contain old values as dimensions change. This might make queries fairly complex, though.
3. Create a new dimensional table row each time the dimensional object changes. The surrogate key will contain the date.

Answer:  Data integration creates a unified view of business data. There are three approaches to data integration. The first approach, which is widely used in data warehousing, is consolidation. In this approach, data are loaded and transformed into a dataset useful for reporting or decision support. Another approach, data federation, provides a virtual view of integrated data without actually bringing the data into one database.

142) Discuss the ETL process.
Answer:  The goal of the ETL process is data reconciliation. This data reconciliation occurs in two stages: when the data is initially loaded and when updates occur. There are five steps to the process of reconciliation (called the ETL process):
1. Mapping and metadata management–here the data needed for the warehouse are mapped back to the data in the operational system.
2. Extract–in this step, we capture any relevant data from the source system.
3. Cleanse–in this step, the data are cleansed so that things such as misspelled names, duplicate data, etc. are removed.
4. Load and Index–here the cleansed data are loaded into the data warehouse and appropriate indexes are created.
