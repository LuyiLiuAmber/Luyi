86) Explain how middleware is used in a two-tier application.
Answer:  Middleware is any class of software that allows an application to interoperate with other software without requiring the user to understand and code the low-level operations required for the interoperability. Database-related middleware consists of an application programmer interface (API) which allows a programmer to connect to an instance of a database. Some examples of these are ODBC, ADO.net, and JDBC. The second type of database middleware is a database driver, which is specific to the database that is being accessed. When middleware is used, there are six basic steps to access a database from within an application:
1. Identify and register a database driver
2. Open a connection to the database
3. Execute a query against the database
4. Process the results of the query
5. Repeats steps 3-4 as needed
6. Close the database connection

87) Discuss some of the key benefits of three-tier applications.
Answer:  Three-tier applications can lead to several benefits in organizations:
1. Scalability–three-tier architecture are more scalable than two-tier. One example would be to use the application server to reduce the load to the database server by using transaction processing monitors
2. Flexibility– in the three-tier architecture, it is easier to switch database engines.
3. Lower long-term costs
4. Improved customer service–multiple interfaces on different clients can access the same business processes
5. Competitive advantage

88) Discuss the differences between two-tier and three-tier architectures.
Answer:  While a two-tier architecture only includes client and database server, a three-tier architecture includes another server in addition to the database server. This can either be an application server, which will contain much of the application logic or a web server. Three-tier architecture has been widely adopted because of increased performance, scalability, flexibility, and reusability.

90) Discuss some of the advantages to using model and view classes in Python.
Answer:  You can change the type of database by changing the values in the settings file. Changes to the table structure require changes to the model but will not affect the view class. Programmers do not need to know the details of SQL because there are methods preprogrammed by the framework.

91) What are the most important security features for data management software?
Answer:  The most important security features of data management software are:
1. Views or subschemas. These restrict user views of the database.
2. Integrity controls such as domains, assertions, checks, etc.
3. Authorization rules which identify users and restrict the actions they may take against a database
4. User-defined procedures which define additional constraints
5. Encryption procedures which encode data in an unrecognizable form
6. Authentication schemas–positively identify individuals trying to gain access to the database

1. Accidental losses, which could be caused by human error, software and hardware-caused breaches
2. Theft and fraud
3. Loss or privacy or confidentiality
4. Loss of data integrity

93) What is the difference between shared locks and exclusive locks?
Answer:  Shared locks allow other transactions to read but not update a record or other resource. This is most useful when preventing another user from placing a lock on a record. An exclusive lock prevents another transaction from reading and writing a record until an update is done by the transaction that locked the record.
