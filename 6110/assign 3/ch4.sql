86) Discuss the various relational keys.
Answer:  A primary key uniquely identifies each row of a relation (or table). It can be either a single column or a composite of two or more columns, which is called a composite key. A foreign key allows us to represent the relationship between two tables. A foreign key in one table is generally a reference to a primary key in another table.

88) Discuss why it is important to remove multivalued attributes from a relation.
Answer:  A multivalued attribute is one that can take on more than one value. According to the definition of a relation, there can be no multivalued attributes. The reason for this will be seen later when the schema is normalized. A multivalued attribute can be resolved by creating a separate instance for each value and repeating the data from the non-multivalued attributes.

90) Explain what a candidate key is and how it might be used.
Answer:  A candidate key is an attribute or a combination of attributes that uniquely identifies a row in a relation. A candidate key must be nonredundant and must also uniquely identify each row. When we look at functional dependencies and candidate keys, we can always say that a determinant is always a candidate key.

91) Discuss how you would map a regular entity to a relation.
Answer:  Each regular entity is transformed into a relation. There are a couple of things that need to be done with some special types of attributes. Composite attributes are broken down into their individual components. Multivalued attributes are broken down into separate relations. For example, if there was a multivalued skill attribute, this would become a skill relation. Also, we ignore derived attributes.

92) How do you convert weak entities to relations?
Answer:  A weak entity becomes a relation. However, since a weak entity instance does not exist by itself, we must create a relation with the primary key from the strong relation as the primary key, as well as the identifying attribute.

93) Discuss when it is best to create a surrogate key for an associative entity.
Answer:  A surrogate key should be created when any of the following conditions hold: there is a composite primary key, the natural primary key is inefficient (such as a long name), or the natural primary key is recycled. When you have an associative entity, it is often best to use a surrogate key when you have more than two relations that the associative entity is related to, since the primary key would be a composite of the primary keys of all entities related to the associative entity.

94) Discuss the two possible scenarios when mapping an associative entity.
Answer:  There are two possible cases for associative entities. In one case, you can have an identifier assigned. You would then use this as the primary key. The other case is where the identifier is not assigned. In this case, you would use the primary keys from the other two (or more) relations that are related to the associative entity.

95) Discuss how to map a unary one-to-many relationship.
Answer:  The entity type in the unary relationship is mapped to a relation in the same way as we did for a relation. We next add a foreign key attribute, which maps back to the primary key. This is called a recursive foreign key. So, if we had a relation such as a person supervises one or more persons, the person_id would be a primary key and then there would be a supervisor id which points back to the person_id.

96) Discuss how to map a unary many-to-many relationship.
Answer:  Two relations are created. One represents the entity type in the relationship, and the other is an associative relation to represent the M:N relationship. The primary key of the associative relation consists of two attributes which take their value from the primary key of the other relation.

97) Explain how subtype/supertype relationships are converted to relations.
Answer:  When we have a supertype/subtype relationship, we need to assign one entity for the supertype and one for each subtype. The supertype has all attributes common to all subtypes as well as a primary key. Each subtype relation has the primary key of the supertype as well as any attributes that are specific to that subtype. Finally, we assign one or more attributes to the supertype to function as subtype discriminators.

98) Discuss the types of integrity constraints.
Answer:  The three major types of integrity constraints are domain constraints, entity integrity, and referential integrity. A domain is a set of attributes assigned to an attribute and consists of the domain name, data type, size, and allowable values. The entity integrity rule is designed to ensure that every relation has a primary key and that the data values for the primary key are valid (in particular, not null). The referential integrity constraint is a rule that maintains consistency among the rows of two relations. If there is a foreign key in one relation, there must be a matching primary key in the other relation or the foreign key must be null.

99) What is an anomaly, and what are the three types of anomalies?
Answer:  An anomaly is an error or inconsistency that may result when a user attempts to update a table that contains redundant data. There are three types of anomalies. An insert anomaly occurs when a user attempts to enter new information for part of a table. For example, if we stored customer address with an order. A deletion anomaly occurs when the user wants to delete part of a record but also has to delete related data. A modification anomaly occurs when we have to change the same data in multiple places.

100) Discuss the two major occasions when you benefit from using normalization.
Answer:  During logical database design, normalization is used as a check and balance to make sure that your E-R diagram is correct as well as your relational schema before doing physical design. Another occasion when you benefit is reverse-engineering an older system, since many of the tables and user views are redundant.

101) List and explain 1st, 2nd, 3rd, BCNF, 4th, and 5th normal forms.
Answer:  There are six different normal forms, all of which build upon each other. When a relation is in first normal form, all repeating groups have been removed. Second normal form means that any partial functional dependencies have been removed. A partial functional dependency occurs when a primary key is a composite key and a nonkey attribute is dependent upon part of the key. A relation is in third normal form when all transitive dependencies have been resolved. A transitive dependency occurs when one nonkey attribute is dependent upon another nonkey attribute. Boyce-Codd normal form removes any further dependencies that may result from anomalies. A relation is in fourth normal form when any dependencies from multivalued attributes have been removed. Fifth normal form removes any further anomalies.
